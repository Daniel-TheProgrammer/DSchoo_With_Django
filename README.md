# D-School-Management-System by DTP

This app is meant to be used by school manager to manage their school records:
student data
staff
results and
finances.


```bash
username: admin
password: admin123
```

## Usage
To me,, It is best for you to install Python projects in a Virtual Environment. Once you have set up a VE, clone this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daniel-TheProgrammer/DSchoo_with_Django.git
```
Then

```bash
cd Django-School-Management-System
```
Run

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt #install required packages
python3 manage.py migrate # run first migration
python3 manage.py runserver # run the server
```
Then locate http://172.0.0.1:8000

## Admin Login
When you run migrate, a superuser is created.
```bash
username: admin
password: admin123
```

## Roadmap
To build a fully fledged open source school management for administrative use only.
